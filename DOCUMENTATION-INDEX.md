## üìù For LLMs / AI Assistants

If you're an LLM or AI assistant taking over this project:

1. **Start with**: [PROJECT-DOCUMENTATION.md](./PROJECT-DOCUMENTATION.md)
   - This has the complete technical context
   - All design decisions and rationale
   - File structure and organization

2. **Review**: [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
   - Understand what changed and why
   - Learn from past issues and fixes

3. **Check**: Component files for current implementation
   - `components/` folder for React components
   - `app/globals.css` for all styles
   - `data/projects.ts` for project data structure

4. **Key Principles to Remember**:
   - Always maintain uniform card heights in grid layouts
   - Use CSS variables for theming
   - Keep Client Components minimal (only when interactivity needed)
   - Test images exist before referencing in data
   - Use descriptive, project-specific image names
   - Navigation should blend at top, separate when scrolled
   - Waves morph on scroll (not just parallax)
   - All cards same height, 2-line title space, 5-line description
