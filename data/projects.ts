    longDescription: `I was tasked with redesigning the sales performance dashboards used in the dominant point-of-sale system in the wireless industry.

We began by conducting interviews with customers to understand what they found useful or not useful in their current dashboard. Each customer had unique preferences; for some, certain metrics were indispensable, while others prioritized different ones. Interestingly, many interviewees admitted to disregarding certain parts of the dashboard altogether.

Based on this feedback, I developed a modular, web-based, fully mobile-friendly, customizable dashboarding system. Users have the flexibility to add and configure metrics they prioritize using a combination of configurable cards. These cards can be tailored in size and viewed as charts, lists, or even maps, offering a multitude of ways to visualize the same data according to a retailer's specific requirements.

This system enables businesses to create and share targeted dashboards to monitor their operations and influence employee behaviour.`,

My approach began with extensive conversations across the organization to ascertain the essential content elements required for the site at a foundational level. Subsequently, I developed wireframes and interaction design patterns covering a wide array of basic use cases, including product launches, events, and the range of products and services offered by Best Buy. By adopting a component-driven strategy and leveraging a content management system, I created multiple design components adaptable to various configurations on different types of pages.

    description: 'Created high-level user journey conceptual blueprint to connect teams with a united vision. Aligned cross-functional teams around shared user experience principles.',
    longDescription: `As part of the Best Buy transformation initiative, I created a high-level user journey conceptual blueprint that served as a foundational artifact to connect cross-functional teams with a united vision. This blueprint was essential for aligning product, engineering, marketing, and design teams around shared user experience principles and a common understanding of customer journeys.

The conceptual blueprint mapped out key customer touchpoints and experiences across the entire bestbuy.ca ecosystem, from discovery through purchase and post-purchase support. By creating this visual and strategic document, I enabled teams to see how their individual work connected to the larger customer experience, fostering better collaboration and decision-making.

This artifact became a critical reference point for strategic planning, helping teams prioritize features and initiatives based on their impact on the overall user journey rather than in isolation. The blueprint ensured that all teams were working toward the same customer experience goals, reducing friction and misalignment across the organization.`,
